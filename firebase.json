/* we have a "Page Not Found" error, the reason is for this, is because this application
 has a single HTML file (index.html) , so when have another url , firebase thinks this is the name 
 of file (fore example here https://rang-13fc3.web.app/login) login.html , but we dont have a file 
 by this name in our directory, so we need to set up a simple rule in firebase and this will tell
 to firebase to redirect any URL to index.html, there our Angular application loads, and our rout 
 is kicks in and take the user to the login page for example */
